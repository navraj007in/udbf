Universal Database Framework
is a Libray for .Net Platform which is used to ease the process of database interaction.
This library provide a universal interface to all the standard databases making the process of 
Inserting, updating and querying a lot easier.

The major benefit of this library is that the code produced is database independent and 
is a project can be migrated from one data base to another database with very little modifications.
One more benefit is it provides support for Server based databases as well as File based systems with sufficient ease.

currently it provides access to MySQL,SQL server, SQLite, MS-Access,ODBC. 
The support for Oracle can be added if some one is willing to take the project further
as currently i dont have an oracle installation on my workstation.
The base interface is quite straight forward and it can be extended to support as many databases
as possible.
